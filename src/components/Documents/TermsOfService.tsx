          Content privately or publicly. Upon any sale or transfer of the Art Content to another
          buyer, the foregoing license will automatically transfer to such other buyer, and such
          other buyer will be deemed the “buyer” and will be subject to these Terms of Use, and the
          seller or transferor will cease to have any further rights to such Art Content.

          not, and will not cause another to, sell, tokenize, or create another cryptographic token,
          in each case representing a digital collectible for the same Art Content, and (c) will not
          make any erroneous or misleading statements regarding any content (including in connection

          likeness, or other unoriginal content not created by the Artist, not authorized for use by
          the Artist, not in the public domain, or otherwise without a valid claim of fair use. The

          SAGE’s policy is to suspend or terminate the account of repeat infringers. SAGE’s response
          may depend on relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances, but generally we will
          terminate a User Account if it is the subject of three valid infringement notices.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          SAGE will not be held liable to any user for removing allegedly infringing works or
          otherwise fulfilling its legal obligations under the DMCA. All Users expressly agree to
          cooperate and timely respond to SAGE’s investigations, requests, and inquiries related to
          DMCA disputes or allegations of infringement. Any person who knowingly materially
          misrepresents that content or an activity is infringing or that any material or activity
          was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable to us and
          possibly others for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us in
          removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing or in
          replacing the removed material or enabling access to it.

          The blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the
          blockchain. This means that all artwork is outside of the control of any one party,
          including SAGE, and is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Therefore, please note the
          following risks in accessing or using the Services:
        </Text>
        <List>
          <li>
            The price and liquidity of blockchain assets are extremely volatile and may be subject
            to large fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect
            the price of any NFT purchased or sold on the website, which may also be subject to
            significant price volatility.
          </li>
          <li>Sage cannot guarantee that any purchasers of product will not lose money.</li>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your
            transactions; SAGE is not responsible for determining what, if any, taxes may apply to
            any transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international
            level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of product.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not
            limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of
            malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized
            access to information stored within your wallet; you accept and acknowledge that SAGE
            will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions
            or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transactions occurring on the website may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due
            to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
          </li>
          <li>
            By using the Services, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely
            responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks
            of a given transaction and the underlying digital assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional
            advice, and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any
            transaction or any underlying digital asset.
          </li>
          <li>
            You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose
            access to your digital assets indefinitely.
          </li>
          <li>You understand and agree that all transaction decisions are made solely by you.</li>
          <li>
            You understand and agree that in the event that you deposit digital assets into an
            incorrect address, SAGE may not have the ability, and are under no obligation or duty,
            to return such digital assets to you (this section applies regardless of whether we
            control the destination address).
          </li>
          <li>
            Some transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is
            not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            The value of any product may be derived from the continued willingness of market
            participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for product, which may result
            in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular NFT should the
            market for that NFT disappear.
          </li>
          <li>
            The nature of NFTs may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack, and may mean
            that any technological difficulties experienced by SAGE may prevent your access to the
            Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, SAGE accepts no responsibility whatsoever
            for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with the use of the
            Services for performing digital asset transactions.
          </li>

        <Text>
          You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature,
          potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that
          SAGE does not give advice or recommendations regarding NFTs, including the suitability and
          appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, NFTs. You agree and understand that you
          access and use the Services at your own risk; however, the foregoing brief statement does
          not disclose all of the risks associated with NFTs and other digital assets. You agree and

          errors, distortions or delays you may experience, however caused.

          contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent

          attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs
          of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and
          nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured,
          or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise
          (collectively, “Claims”), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal
          injury (including death), that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) any
          intellectual property disputes; (b) your use or misuse of the Services or the website; (c)
          your violation, breach, or threatened breach of these Terms of Use; (d) your violation of
          the rights of a third party, including another user; or (e) any breach or threatened
          breach by you of your representations and warranties set forth herein. You agree to
          promptly notify SAGE of any third party Claims and cooperate with the SAGE Parties in
          defending such Claims. You further agree that the SAGE Parties shall have the right to
          control the defense or settlement of any third party Claims as they relate to SAGE, if it
          so chooses. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section
          1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or
          releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
          executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his
          or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are a resident of another
          jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine. This indemnity is in addition
          to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you
          and SAGE. This indemnity is further in addition to, and not in lieu of, any and all other
          remedies that SAGE may possess at law or in equity.

          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND
          OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE
          AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE
          AGAINST SAGE TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. FURTHER, (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO
          PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST SAGE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK
          RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS,

          SAGE prefers to resolve disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can
          be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting SAGE. If such efforts
          prove unsuccessful, the parties agree to submit to binding arbitration as follows: Any
          dispute or claim relating in any way to: your access, use, or attempted access or use of
          the website; any products sold or distributed through the website; or any aspect of your
          relationship with SAGE will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that (1) you may
          assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or SAGE may seek
          equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights
          (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyright, or patent). You
          agree that any such arbitration shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding
          arbitration held in Maine and conducted in English, rather than in court.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (1) determine the scope and
          enforceability of these arbitration provisions; and (2) resolve any dispute related to the
          interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these arbitration
          provisions, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of these arbitration
          provisions is void or voidable; (3) decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
          SAGE; (4) grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim; (5) award monetary
          damages and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to a party under applicable
          law, arbitration rules, and these Terms of Use (including these arbitration provisions).
          The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge
          in a court of law would have. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
          including the calculation of any damages awarded. Such an award is final and binding upon
          you and us.

        <Text>
          All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the
          arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          If any part of these arbitration provisions is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then
          such part shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of these
          arbitration provisions shall continue to in full force and effect.

          You understand that by agreeing to these arbitration provisions, you and SAGE are each

          arbitration.
