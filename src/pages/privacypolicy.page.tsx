          When you access SAGE Services, we may make use of the standard practice of placing tiny
          data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking tools (herein,
          &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;) on your computer or other devices used to visit us. We use Cookies
          to help us recognize you as a customer, collect information about your use of our Services
          to better customize our Services and content for you, and collect information about your
          computer or other access devices to: (i) ensure that your account security has not been
          compromised by detecting irregular, suspicious, or potentially fraudulent account
          activities; and (ii) assess and improve our services and advertising campaigns. Please
          note that if you reject cookies, you will not be able to use some or all of our Services.
          If you do not consent to the placing of Cookies on your device, please do not visit,
          access, or use our Services.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          In addition to Cookies, we use &ldquo;Pixel Tags&rdquo; (also referred to as clear gifs,
          web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier,
          similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In
          contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user&rsquo;s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags
          are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a
          format that users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure
          that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this
          information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information
          gathered by Pixel Tags to our users&rsquo; Personal Data.

        <Text>
          We employ a number of reasonable technical, organizational and physical safeguards
          designed to protect the personal information we collect and to guard against accidental
          loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. However, no security is
          foolproof, and the Internet is an insecure medium. We cannot guarantee absolute security,
          but we work hard to protect SAGE and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized
          alteration, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information we collect and store.
          Measures we take include encryption of our website communications with SSL; optional
          two-factor authentication; periodic review of our Personal Information collection,
          storage, and processing practices; and restricted access to your Personal Information on a
          need-to-know basis for our employees, contractors and agents who are subject to strict
          contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail
          to meet these obligations. Nevertheless, it remains your responsibility: (a) to protect
          against unauthorized access to your use of the Services; (b) to ensure no one else uses
          the Services while your device is logged on to SAGE (including by logging on to your
          device through a mobile, Wi-Fi, or shared access connection you are using); (c) to log off
          or exit from the Services when not using them; (d) where relevant, to keep your password
          or other access information secret (your password and log in details are personal to you
          and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a
          network); and (e) to maintain good internet security.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          If you think that your user account has been compromised you should change your account
          credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow
          access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as you can, so that we can
          try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be
          affected.

          consent of the child&rsquo;s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete that
